# Creates a compressed ZIP archive of the release binary for distribution
# on GitHub.
#
# This script automatically detects the host operating system and architecture
# to create a correctly named asset file that the `boot` CLI can discover
# and download.
#
# Usage:
#   From the root of the boot-rust repository, run:
#   ./scripts/create_release_zip.sh
#
# The output will be a file like `target/release/boot-rust-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip`.

set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

# --- Configuration ---
# The name of your plugin binary. This should match the `name` in your Cargo.toml.
PLUGIN_NAME="boot-rust"
# The directory where the final zip file will be placed.
RELEASE_DIR="target/release"

# --- Main Logic ---

# Function to print a styled message.

# 3. Create the ZIP Archive
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Construct the final filename based on the detected platform.
# e.g., boot-rust-x86_64-apple-darwin.zip
ZIP_FILENAME="${PLUGIN_NAME}-${arch}-${os}.zip"

# -j "junk paths" flag stores files at the root of the zip, removing the directory structure.

# 4. Final Summary
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
