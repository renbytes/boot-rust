# Creates compressed ZIP archives of the release binary for macOS platforms.
#
# This script builds for both Apple Silicon and Intel architectures and creates
# correctly named asset files that the `boot` CLI can discover and download.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - `rustup` must be installed.
#
# Usage:
#   From the root of the boot-rust repository, run:
#   ./scripts/create_release_zip.sh
#
# The output will be multiple .zip files in the `target/` directory.

set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

# --- Configuration ---
# The name of your plugin binary. This should match the `name` in your Cargo.toml.
PLUGIN_NAME="boot-rust"
# The root directory where release assets will be created.
RELEASE_DIR="target"

# An array of Rust target triples to build for.
# We are now only building for macOS targets.

  "aarch64-apple-darwin"      # For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
  "x86_64-apple-darwin"       # For Intel-based Macs

  # 2. Build the release binary using the standard `cargo build`.
  cargo build --release --target "${target}"

  # 3. Define platform-specific variables for naming the final asset.

  asset_os="apple-darwin" # This is constant for both macOS targets
